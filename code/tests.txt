	* Disabling the entry for "BeamGet" on Plasma Beam and the others inside "ItemGrab" makes it so the item isn't toggled automatically.
However, having Starting Items active alongside with Item Grab gives the unexpected side-effect of still being able to toggle the UnkItem on or off, which defeats the purpose.

	* Disabling Starting Items all together restores the UnkItems to behave like in vanilla ZM.
But, with Starting Items inactive, now the Full Suit for Varia doesn't work.

Find a way to make both Item Grab and Starting Items work alongside each other. Right now I can only have either Full Varia or Unk Items, but not both at the same time.
